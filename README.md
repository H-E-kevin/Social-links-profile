## My process

I started by picturing it out in HTMl and writing out the code. Then i moved on to the css which was relatively easy but time consuming.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="attribution">
	Challenge by
	<a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank"
		>Frontend Mentor</a
	>. Coded by <a href="#">H.E Kevin</a>
</div>
```

```css
.container .img img {
	border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

The sizing and the responsive design were a little challenging. But i believe it will come easier with time and practice.
